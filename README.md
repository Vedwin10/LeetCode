# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my personal repository of LeetCode solutions! 🧠✨  
This repo is a collection of problems I've solved to strengthen my understanding of **Data Structures and Algorithms**, and to grow comfortable coding in both **C++** and **Python**.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder corresponds to one LeetCode problem and contains:

```plaintext
ProblemName/
-- problem.txt       # Problem description
-- solution.cpp      # Solution in C++
```

## Goals

- Practice and retain key DSA concepts.
- Maintain a well-organized archive of past problems and solutions.
- View previous solutions and iteratively improve progamming skills over time.

## Problems Solved

- **Easy:** 2
- **Medium:** 0
- **Hard:** 0

## Why This Repo?

This repo is both:
- A **learning journal** to track my DSA journey
