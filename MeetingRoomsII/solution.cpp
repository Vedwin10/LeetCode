// Essentially we want to know the maximum number of meetings going on at any given point in time
// We can start this by having a running count of how many meetings are currently going on, add +1 every time a new meeting starts, and -1 every time an old one ends
// Using an array of meetings start/end times and 1/-1 respectively, we can traverse the (sorted) array adding the second value and updating the max value
// Array should be sorted by first value, and tiebreakers are dealt with by ending old meetings first, and then starting new ones
